Former three spinner objects was using all mcu power. So they've been replaced with arc objects instead
Arc objects colouring determined by percentage of:
- Daily solar yield/Predicted daily yield
- Own consumption of solar power/grid import
- Export to grid/Import from grid
Entire config done in configurations - openHASP Custom Componenet mandatory
